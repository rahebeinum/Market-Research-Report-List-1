<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Scale LNG Terminals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquefaction Terminals</li><li>Regasification Terminals</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Small scale LNG terminals are categorized into two main types: liquefaction terminals and regasification terminals. Liquefaction terminals convert natural gas into liquid form for easier transportation and storage, typically located near gas supply sources. Conversely, regasification terminals convert LNG back into gaseous form for distribution to consumers and are usually situated near demand centers. Both terminal types facilitate the growing use of LNG in energy markets, enabling flexibility and efficiency in supply chains while supporting cleaner energy transitions.</p></p>
