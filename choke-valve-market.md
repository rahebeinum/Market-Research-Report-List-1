<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Choke Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight-through Type</li><li>Angle Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The choke valve market is primarily segmented into two types: straight-through and angle types. Straight-through choke valves allow fluid to flow in a linear path, minimizing pressure drop and turbulence, making them suitable for high-capacity applications. Angle choke valves, on the other hand, change the direction of flow by 90 degrees, which can provide better control in specific installations. Both types are crucial for regulating flow and pressure in various industries, including oil and gas, water treatment, and chemical processing.</p></p>
